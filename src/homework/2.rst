1. From the book, Chapter 1 Summary and Concept Review, pages 71 - 74:

   # 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 17, 19, 21, 51, 55, 57

2. Notes:  Treat this assignment like a test  -- try to answer as much as possible without looking up concepts in the book.  This will help you identify topics you need to review as we move into new material.

3. Instructions:  All homework assignments are due on the class day given in the assignment description -- so Homework 2 is due in class on Day 2, HW 3 will be due on Day 3, etc.  Please complete all assignments on paper (unless instructed otherwise), and turn them in at the BEGINNING of class each day.
