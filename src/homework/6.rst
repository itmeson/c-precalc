2. Feel free to use desmos.com or other graphing calculator as an aid in doing these problems.

3. Notes: Please look at the website geogebra.org, and investigate whether you have a device that you could bring to class that will run the geogebra app -- either the desktop or web(Chrome) version.  Hopefully around 10 of you at least would be able to do this, so we can use it in class after the holiday break.
