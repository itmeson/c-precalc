1. Consider the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{-3x + 2}$

   a. What are the possible outputs of this function?
  
   b. Give another function that has the same set of possible inputs, but a different set of possible outputs.
   
   c. Give another function that has the same set of possible outputs, but a different set of possible inputs.


2. Consider the functions $f(x) = \\sqrt{x+5}$ and $g(x) = x^2 + 3$

   a. State the domain and range of each function

   b. Find the composition $f(g(x))$.  What is its domain and range?

   c. Find the composition $g(f(x))$.  What is its domain and range?

   d. (BONUS) Find a function $h(x)$ such that $h(g(x)) = 1$


3. The following are lengths of sides of right triangles, in order of increasing size.  Find the length of the missing side:

   a. 3, x, 6
   b. 4, 4, x


4.  Draw a unit circle, labelling angles ($0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\ldots$) and showing the definitions of the sine, cosine, secant, cosecant, and tangent functions.


5. A wheel of radius 30 centimeters turns through 4.5 revolutions in 45 seconds.

   a. By what angle (in radians) does the wheel turn?
   b. How far does the vehicle attached to the wheel travel?
   c. Consider a point on the wheel that is initially in contact with the ground.  Construct a function that describes the height of that point above the ground as the wheel turns.
   d. Graph the function in (c) for times between 0 and 45 seconds.


6. Bacteria grow in a process in which each bacteria cell splits in half every 20 minutes.  Imagine that you are infected by a single bacteria at Noon.

   a.  What time will it be when there are 6 million (or more) bacteria present?
   b.  Suppose you have a detergent that can kill exactly two-thirds of any bacteria present each time you wash with it.  Obviously, you will have to apply it more than once to get the number of bacteria back below 1.  How many times will you have to use the detergent?
   c.  Make sure to express the processes in a and b using expressions that involve exponents.
