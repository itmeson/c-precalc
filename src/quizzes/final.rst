1. Consider the function $f(x) = \\sqrt{-3x + 2}$

   a. What are the possible outputs of this function?
  
   b. Give another function that has the same set of possible inputs, but a different set of possible outputs.
   
   c. Give another function that has the same set of possible outputs, but a different set of possible inputs.


2. Consider the functions $f(x) = \\sqrt{x+5}$ and $g(x) = x^2 + 3$

   a. State the domain and range of each function

   b. Find the composition $f(g(x))$.  What is its domain and range?

   c. Find the composition $g(f(x))$.  What is its domain and range?

   d. (BONUS) Find a function $h(x)$ such that $h(g(x)) = 1$


3. The following are lengths of sides of right triangles, in order of increasing size.  Find the length of the missing side:

   a. 3, x, 6
   b. 4, 4, x


4. If a wheel of radius 30 centimeters turns through 20.5 revolutions, how far
does the wheel travel, and by what angle (in radians) does it turn?


5.  Draw a unit circle, labelling angles ($0, \\frac{\\pi}{6}, \\frac{\\pi}{4}, \\frac{\\pi}{3}, \\ldots$) and showing the definitions of the sine, cosine, secant, cosecant, and tangent functions.

1. Without a calculator,  consider what happens to the function f(x) = cos(x) when the underlying unit circle has a radius of 4.  Express a new function that gives the x-coordinate of points on the circle at given radii x, and sketch the function neatly showing the  value at standard angles.

1. Suppose a tire of radius 0.5 meters is spinning at the rate of 2 radians per second.  Imagine a line drawn through the center of the tire (using chalk) that is initially parallel with the ground.  Sketch a graph showing the height of the end of that line as a function of time for 20 seconds.  Then write in functional form:  f(x) =  ?

The mythical Hydra was a beast that was very difficult to kill -- if you cut
off its head, it grew 12 new ones to replace it.  If you cut off one of those
heads, 12 more would grow... if you cut off one of those, 12 more would grow
....

The mythical Super-Hydra is even worse -- cutting off the one head causes 12
more to grow, but cutting off one of the new heads causes all of them to die!
For an instant... and then ALL 12 OF THEM SPROUT 12 NEW HEADS!
  
1. Write equations describing the number of heads as a function of the number of times you've cut off a head for both the regular Hydra and the Super-Hydra.
 
2. How many heads would you have to cut off before each Hydra gets to 1 BILLION
heads?  Use the equations in 1 to solve without using guess and check.
