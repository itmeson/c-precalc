1. What are the domain and range of the function $f(x) = \\frac{\\sqrt{x+3}}{x+2}$?

2. Give a function that has the same domain, but a different range from the function $g(x) = -\\sqrt{x - 4}$

3. The function $t(r) = \\frac{h\\pi r^2}{R}$ models the time $t$ it takes for an oil slick to spread to a radius $r$.  Find the function $r(t)$, and explain what that function tells you (ie What is the input, what is the output?)
