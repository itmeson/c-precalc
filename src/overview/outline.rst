COURSE OUTLINE** (2012-2013)
============================

**COURSE TITLE:**  QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS I

**COURSE NUMBER:**		MATH1930

**QUARTER CREDIT HOURS:**	4.5

**CONTACT HOURS:** 	45 lecture hours

**PREREQUISITE(S):**  MATH1020 or equivalent, or permission of department chair, or placement

===================
COURSE DESCRIPTION:
=================== 
a continuation of Algebra, this course begins with
the study of linear equations and their applications to business and
economics.  Matrices are covered in detail.  Linear programming,
quadratic models and a brief introduction to differential calculus are
also presented.  .

================
COURSE OUTCOMES:
================
Upon satisfactory completion of this course, a student should have the ability to:  

 1. Correctly perform basic algebraic operations including solving linear systems and working with rational functions on both examinations and in assigned work.
 2. Correctly graph both linear and quadratic functions, and correctly apply the laws of supply and demand, cost, revenue, profit, and consumption theories to business problems on both examinations and in assigned work.
 3. Correctly solve linear systems in either two or three unknown variables by graphical and/or algebraic methods – including matrix methods – on both examinations and in assigned work.
 4. Correctly formulate and solve linear programming problems which appear on examinations and in assigned work.
 5. Correctly differentiate polynomial and rational functions and correctly apply the same to the solution of problems in a business-related environment on both examinations and in assigned work.
 6. Demonstrate sufficient mathematical literacy as indicated by the University test for the Performance Transcript.
