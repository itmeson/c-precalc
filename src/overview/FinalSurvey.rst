1. Go to the following survey_

2. Fill it out with your thoughts on the class.  I REALLY appreciate honest feedback, and will make changes next term in response to your thoughts, so please take time to honestly reflect on your experience.  The long-response questions near the bottom are the most helpful.

3. Make sure to enter your JWU email address at the bottom, so you can get credit for doing the survey.  Your responses will NOT be linked with your name.
